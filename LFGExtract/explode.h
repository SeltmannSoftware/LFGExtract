/* Extract a file from an archive file and explode it.
   in_fp:           Pointer to imploded data start in archive file.
   out_filename:    Output filename [consider making this fp_out].
   expected_length: Expected length of file (0 if not provided).
   eof_reached():   Callback that indicates archive EOF is reached.
                    Callback should return new file pointer with
                    the continued data for the imploded file.
